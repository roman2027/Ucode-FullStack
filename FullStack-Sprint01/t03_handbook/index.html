                <p>Internet Protocol (IP) – a set of rules that dictate how data should be delivered over the public network (Internet). Often works in conjunction with the transmission control protocol (TCP), which divides traffic into packets for efficient transport through the Internet; together they are referred to as TCP/IP.</p>
                <span class="example_left">For example, when an email (using the simple mail transfer protocol – SMTP) is sent from an email server, the TCP layer in that server will divide the message up into multiple packets, number them and then forward them to the IP layer for transport. At the IP layer, each packet will be transported to the destination email server. While each packet is going to the same place, the route they take to get there may be different. When it arrives, the IP layer hands it back to the TCP layer, which reassembles the packets into the message and hands it to the email application, where it shows up in the Inbox.</span>

                <h2>HTTP/HTTPS</h2>
                <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>

                <h2>IP - how to determine<br>   an IP address</h2>
                <p>Another way to check the IP address for a website is to use the nslookup command from a command prompt. Most operating systems, whether they are Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, etc., provide that tool, which is specifically for looking up IP addresses. E.g., suppose I wanted to look up the IP address of google, I could use the command nslookup www.google.com as shown below where the command is run on a Microsoft Windows system:</p>
                <span class="example_left">C:>nslookup www.google.com <br>
                    Server: UnKnown <br>
                    Address: 192.168.0.15 <br>
                    Non-authoritative answer: <br>
                    Name: www.google.com <br>
                    Addresses: 2607:f8b0:4002:c09::68 <br>
                    173.194.37.84 <br>
                    173.194.37.80 <br>
                    173.194.37.83 <br>
                    173.194.37.81 <br>
                    173.194.37.82</span>
                <p>The line immediately below the "Server" line is the IP address of the DNS server that provided the information for google.com. The Addresses line shows an IPv6 address for google.com. IPv6 is a newer version of the Internet Protocol; many websites are now accessible using IPv6, though IPv4 is still widely used. There is no version 5 in use on the Internet; that number was skipped. Most people are more familiar with the IPv4 style addresses, which are the ones shown for google.com below the Addresses line. <br><br>
                    You will see that there are four IPv4 addresses shown. Many large companies will have more than one IP address associated with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as google.com. When a system out on the Internet looks up google.com, the IP address that is returned by the DNS servers Google uses won't necessarily be the same each time. <br><br>
                    Many large companies with publicly accessible websites use a round-robin DNS technique for associating IP addresses with their web servers, so that if thousands, or even millions, of people may be accessing their servers simultaneously, they won't all be accessing the same server, since the DNS servers will cycle through a list of IP addresses that are returned for DNS queries for an IP address for a web server, thus distributing the load on the company's servers.</p>
